                    Secret object: <strong>pencil</strong><br>
                    Clue 1: <strong>school bus</strong> - A pencil and a school bus share the same color.
                    However, the guessers don't know what attribute a school bus shares with the secret object. From their perspective,
                    the secret object could be a loaf of bread (shape), an elephant (size), a limousine (category).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Clue 2: <strong>piece of paper</strong> - A pencil and a piece of paper are both in the same category. From the
                    guesser's perspective, there are lots of different combinations of what the secret object could be.
                    It could be a white vehicle. Or, it could be a massive blanket (same size as a school bus and same shape as a piece of paper).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Clue 3: <strong>knife</strong> - A pencil and a knife are the same size. There are so many possibilities for the
                    secret object. It could be a yellow, rectangular kitchen utensil!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Clue 4: <strong>pool noodle</strong> - A pencil and a pool noodle are the same shape. Notice that each clue object shared
                    a different attribute with the secret object.

                    Be creative! There's flexibility in how attributes match. A potato and a baseball might be similar sizes to one person but different to another. The fun is in thinking creatively!
